# NLTK_Naive_Bayes
This project will implement a Naïve Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
A large dataset of reviews for Ford motor vehicles is provided, and there are no neutral reviews.

The task is to implement a Naïve Bayes classifier using 80% (1106) of the reviews as training data. The
training data will be selected at random from the full dataset. And the classifier will be tested using the remaining 20% (276)
of the reviews and report the classifier’s performance using a confusion matrix.
